	<!-- OpenBSD Section -->
	<h1>OpenBSD Unix</h1>
	<a href="https://openbsd.org" target="_blank"><img src="photos/OpenBSD-Puffy.svg" border="0" /></a>
	<p>OpenBSD Unix is my favorite Unix. Security is the primary focus of OpenBSD, and it is safe to say OpenBSD is the most secure
	computer operating system. It is also free to install and use.</p>
	<p>OpenBSD was started by Theo de Raadt in the 1990's, after he left the NetBSD project. BSD Unix stands for Berkely Software Distribution 
	and due to it's permissive licensing, now has many incarnations such as NetBSD Unix, FreeBSD Unix, and other versions also.</p>
	<p>BSD Unix is also the core of the Apple macOS and iOS operating systems. Steve Jobs and the 
    Apple engineers decided to use BSD Unix to save time and money, and also to prevent "reinventing the wheel".</p>
	<p>OpenBSD Unix shell accounts are available free of charge at <a href="https://tilde.institute" target="_blank" />Tilde.Institute</a>.</p>
	<p>I plan to extensively use OpenBSD Unix in the future.</p>

	<!-- SuSE Section-->
	<h1>SuSE Linux</h1>
	<a href="https://www.opensuse.org/" target="_blank"><img src="photos/suse.jpg" border="" /></a>
	<p>SuSE Linux is my favorite Linux. It was started in the early years of Linux in the 1990's by Code Geeks in Germany, and for many
	years the extensive shell script library included with SuSE would have all the comments in German. Now in modern times, SuSE Linux
	has morphed into a billion dollar provider of Enterprise Technology Solutions for government and business.</p>
	<p>SuSE Linux first caught my eye in 1999 when I spotted the box set at CompUSA in Melbourne, Florida. I bought it and installed it in a dual boot with Windows 98 on my laptop, 
	and was impressed with how easy it was to use.</p>
	<p>During that same year 1999, I started in my first software job in the Space Shuttle Program 
	at Kennedy Space Center. My job sat me down in front of an HP-UX Unix workstation and I was responsible for working with XWindows/Motif GUI Apps 
	written in the C programming language, and also I worked with shell scripts. Everything I learned at that job with Unix, I could apply and use 
	with SuSE Linux in my personal time with my laptop, and vice-versa. It was a good synergy for myself, a young software engineer 
	just getting his start.</p>
	<p>
	One time at my Space Shuttle job, I developed a C program to run on the HP-UX Unix workstations that had like 100 pointers in it! 
	As anyone with C experience knows, C pointers can be very fickle and difficult to work with, 
	I was always worried the application would fail in some spectacular manner, but it did not, 
	it worked good and the Space Shuttle aerospace engineers who used it were very pleased with it.
		</p>
	<p>I still use SuSE Linux today. I have the free version openSuSE Leap installed on my laptop, and also recently used the Enterprise 
	version with a VM I setup in my Microsoft Azure Cloud account.</p>
	<p>I plan to extensively use SuSE Linux in the future.</p>

	<p><strong>OpenBSD Unix and Kali Linux side by side, good use of older dell laptops</strong></p>

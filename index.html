	<p>
	I am a long time software engineer and technologist. I had my first start in software programming the Commodore 64 when I was 13, and had my first professional software job
	in the Space Shuttle program working for a NASA contractor, I had an HP-UX Unix workstation at this job and was involved in developing shell scripts and C/C++ software.  The Unix workstations
	ran CDE (Common Desktop Environment) which is based on X Windows, and is now obsolete, having been mostly replaced with Gnome. I was involved in developing C programs with X Windows/Motif that 
	used linked lists and Oracle Pro-C, which let you embed database SQL statements in the C code. These worked with the Shuttle Data Center (SDC), an Oracle data warehouse hosted on Digital Unix 
	Servers. Oracle made a small fortune off the tax payer building the Shuttle Data Center (SDC), which contained all the launch data for the Space Shuttle. Later I was involved in replacing the X 
	Windows/Motif applications with Java Swing and JDBC, which was a big improvement. And also I was later involved in migrating the HP-UX workstations to be replaced with 
	Red Hat Linux workstations, Red Hat also made a tidy sum from the tax payer with that project.
	</p>
	<p>
	One time at this job, I developed a C program to run on the HP-UX Unix workstations that had like 100 pointers in it! As anyone with C experience knows, C pointers can be very fickle and difficult to work 
with, I was always worried the application would fail in some spectacular manner, but it did not, it worked good and the Space Shuttle aerospace engineers who used it were very pleased with it.
